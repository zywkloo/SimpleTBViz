Hello. Now I want to share you something. Yeah. This is a simple triblive.com. This is my individual assignment
for 532. So basically, it's tracking the global TB cases per million people in 2022. So basically it comes with the four parts of input. The first part is the um, the toggle to indicate which kind of, uh, trend you want to look
at. So the second one is the, uh, iso3 code for the country. Once you input a valid country as code so you can see the country specific trend. Also, you can switch between the incidence and mortality from
the the third input is a country full country name. You can see the drop down. You come with the the full list of all related country is quite advanced. So you can simply press that one. So oh that data uh because this is not Korea
Yeah. Doesn't include. So you can try uh Afghanistan. You can see that it's, uh, pretty neat. Yeah it's Afghanistan also here is the view as well. Actually it's, uh, the latest one you have changed. So the third. Yeah. This, uh, the fourth input is kind of you can
directly click the, the country area on the map. So very intuitive. You can see that change accordingly. It was developed with the Python Fast API. This is the backend framework. And also the
GIS framework. Uh D3 GIS is a kind of JavaScript framework. It was hosted on the Heroku. So it's public on the uh, worldwide. Uh, so it's worldwide public domain. So you can see I also pre-process the data
with the, uh, pandas is also panda. Pandas is also kind of Python data framework. Uh, it's very friendly. Yeah. We have we have to deal with a lot with pandas, um, class. So this data was sourced by the W.H.O., who
Okay. Never mind. Here, you can see I'll basically walk you through the, uh, the code. You can see this is the readme. Instructions how to deploy locally
So this part is the main entry for the Python Fast API backend code. It's pretty simple, but uh, anyway, fast API is easier. Much easier to set up than the the other Python server framework
for example Django or uh, uh, flask. I will show you the main entry for the HTML. You can see that I imported the d3 js framework and
this is also you call the, uh, geo map APIs. That's all JavaScript. Yeah, it's pretty challenging thing. So but, uh, what's trying. Yeah, I want to try something different other than R or Python.
Also separate the, uh, a lot of JavaScript code from the, uh, main function. You can see that it's, uh, a different kinds of callbacks and these async asynchronized, it's
uh, in Python, we, I don't think we have this decorator is pretty different. I think it's pretty, uh, compile the Python code base is pretty robust. Yeah. So basically, I finished the two parts of the challenging, uh, challenging section
One is the remote host, the other is the advanced callbacks, because all the callbacks have made the, uh, endoscopy and the basically the async. Yeah. So that's all. 
Thank you. Yeah
